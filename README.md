# W3C DID Method Spec for `did:git:`

This repo is the central coordination point for work on the
[W3C DID method specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) for
Git repositories. If you would like to participate, we encourage you to join
the [mailing list](https://groups.io/g/did-git/topics) and make sure you're
familiar with decentralized identifiers (DID) and the problem we're trying to
solve by reading the [DID primer](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-primer/).

## TODO:

- [ ] Add version to `did-git-spec.md` see [method registry requirement 2](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/#the-registration-process).
- [ ] Request that the spec be include in the [DID method registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/).
- [ ] Add terminology section to the spec to define repo ID, committer ID, etc.
- [ ] Complete the sections on motivation.
- [ ] Finish the CRUD operations for both repo and committer DID strings.
- [ ] Reconcile difference between `did-dir-spec.md` and `did-git-spec.md` to create standard for on-disk DID documents as keyring.
